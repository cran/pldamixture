\description{
The \code{lifem} data set contains a subset of data from the Life-M project (\url{https://life-m.org/}) on 3,238 individuals born between 1883
to 1906. These records were obtained from linking birth certificates and death certificates either of two
ways. A fraction of the records (2,159 records) were randomly sampled to be “hand-linked at some level” (HL).
These records are high quality and were manually linked at some point by trained research assistants.
The remaining records were “purely machine-linked” (ML) based on probabilistic record linkage without clerical
review. The Life-M team expects the mismatch rate among these records to be around 5\% (Bailey et al.
2022). Of interest is the relationship between age at death and year of birth. The \code{lifem} demo data set consists of 2,159 hand-linked records
and 1,079 records that were randomly sampled from the purely machine-linked records (~2:1 HL-ML ratio).

\details{
\itemize{
\item yob: year of birth (value from 1883 and 1906)
\item unit_yob: yob re-scaled to the unit interval for analysis (between 0 and 1). If X is the yob, we use the following:
(X – min(X)) / (max(X) – min(X)) = a * X + b, a = 1/(max(X) – min(X)), b = -min(X)*a
\item age_at_death: age at death (in years)
\item hndlnk: whether record was purely machine-linked or hand-linked at some level.
\item commf: commonness score of first name (between 0 and 1). It is based on the 1940 census.
It is a ratio of the log count of the individual’s first name over the log count of the most
commonly occurring first name in the census.
\item comml: commonness score of last name (between 0 and 1). It is based on the 1940 census.
It is a ratio of the log count of the individual’s last name over the log count of the most
commonly occurring last name in the census.
